This concept was initially thought of by Abram Hindle and then refined further by Daryl Posnett. 

Suggested performance by Daryl:

Take 1 sack of oregano and weigh it out on each scale til they balance.
Wipe off each scale and bag the contents of each scale. 
Sell/share the oregano with others afterwards.

Oolong tea could be used as well -- abram

Abram's suggested performance: 

Get beans or something you don't care too much about and weigh them. You can dash the beans off the scale any time.

Other concepts:

Entropy as balance. High entropy implies a balance of weight between the scales.

Scales used:
